            Having outlined how suppliers are responding to changing traveler needs, let’s look at what this means for travel agencies (agencies, OTAs and TMCs).

            <p className='text-justify text-2xl px-20'>
            Since the beginning of the crisis, travel agencies have played a key role in acting as trusted advisors in a rapidly changing situation — providing updated policy information and facilitating journey changes and cancellations. And now that people are willing to travel again, the priority for agencies is shifting once more — to assure travelers that it is safe to travel. They are doing this by providing information on the supplier safety and hygiene measures that travelers confirm are key to influencing bookings.

             <li><strong>33%</strong> of people are now more likely to book using a travel agent, with 82% being either more likely or the same as before.</li>
                <li><strong>65%</strong> say the information and insight agents can provide is their most crucial draw. As we have already seen in the previous section, this was mirrored by our qualitative research with our supply-side partners, who confirmed that travel agencies will be instrumental in communicating their safety measures and policy updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Almost a quarter (23%)</strong> of travelers are drawn to agents for their ability to change a ticket.</li>
                <li><strong>39%</strong> of young travelers (18-38yrs) are now more likely to use a travel agency to book their trip, representing the biggest change.</li>
